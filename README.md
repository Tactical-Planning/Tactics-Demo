# Tactics Game Demo

## Designed and Programmed by Andy Smith and Jack Brigleb

The aim of this project is to create the infrastructure of a Tactical Role Playing Game, emulating the design of series such as Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics. The project was built so that multiple games could be made utilizing what has been created so far. The code was written in such a way as to minimize effort required to change particular design decisions, and allow for as many extensions to the project or shifts in gameplay design as possible.

The current build is a demo of the features present in the system developed, with “programmer art” and use of sound effects found on opengameart.org ( credited below* ). Two simple levels are included, in order to show that maps of arbitrary size can be made, with walls/obstructions present in the second. The build also presents the party management menu, accessible between levels.

The project was designed and implemented almost entirely by pair coding, both developers working on a single machine, trading roles occasionally. Near the end of development of the
current build, tasks were split up and handled by utilizing this Git repository.

A playable build of the game can be downloaded at https://tactical-planning.itch.io/tactics-demo
